# Amazon-User-Segmentation
Project Title: Amazon User Segmentation with K-means Clustering

Description:

This project aims to analyze Amazon user data and segment customers into distinct groups using the powerful K-means clustering algorithm. By identifying common purchasing behaviors and preferences among users, this segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies and personalized recommendations, ultimately enhancing the user experience.

Key Features:

Utilized K-means Clustering: Employed the K-means algorithm for customer segmentation based on purchase history and preferences.

Interactive Charts: Visualized the results using interactive charts and graphs to provide valuable insights into user segments.

Google Colab IDE: Developed and implemented the project in Google Colab, taking advantage of its collaborative and computational capabilities.

Technologies Used:

Python
Google Colab
K-means Clustering
Data Visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Results:

The project successfully grouped Amazon users into distinct segments, allowing for more effective marketing strategies and personalized recommendations. These insights can potentially lead to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.
